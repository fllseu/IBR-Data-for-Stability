#### Abstract: 
In 2017 and 2018, large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) tripping events occurred after transmission grid disturbances. Sub-cycle
overvoltage is identified as the main cause that the PV invertersâ€™ protection systems initiated tripping actions. According to
the reports from North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), overvoltage is more severe at the PV inverter buses
compared to the point of measurement (POM). Mechanism analysis of such a feature is an open research problem in the NERC
community. This paper fills the gap. The goal of this paper is to explain why inverters may experience more severe overvoltage
compared to the POM bus, which usually has shunt compensation installed. Through circuit construction with inverter control
included, this paper will analyze and demonstrate the role of inverter control in aggravating overvoltage due to its capacitive
nature in the subcycle dynamic range. While this nature is well known to the power electronics community, the current paper
connects the dots to demonstrate how the capacitive nature of inverters can influence solar PV operation in a grid. A quantitative
analysis is presented to explain the overvoltage mechanism
