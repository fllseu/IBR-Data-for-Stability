### Abstract:
On July 7 2020, approximately 1000 MW reduction in solar photovoltaic (PV) output was experienced by the bulk power system in Southern California after a three-phase fault. Disturbance analysis indicates that instantaneous AC current caused inverter tripping. The projection of the root cause of AC overcurrent from the NERC report is that inverter current control is not tight. This letter provides a quantitative analysis on ac overcurrent and addresses the following questions: (i) what type of current controls may lead to ac overcurrent and (ii) how controller parameters and grid strength may influence ac overcurrent. The letter provides frequency-domain analysis and time-domain simulation results of a grid-integrated inverter to illustrate the effect of control parameters and grid strength on ac overcurrent.
