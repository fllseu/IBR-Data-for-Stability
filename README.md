# IBR-Data-for-Stability


This folder contains data collected for IBR stability.
1. Event 1: 0.1-Hz oscillation event. Real power, reactive power, and voltage measurement of 1-s interval for about 2 hours are presented. 
2. Event 2: 19-Hz oscillation event. Real power, reactive power, and voltage voltage measuremets of 0.02-s interval are presented.
