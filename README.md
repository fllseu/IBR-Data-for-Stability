# IBR-Data-for-Stability


This folder contains data collected for IBR stability.
1. Event 1: 0.1-Hz oscillation event. Real power, reactive power, and voltage measurement of 1-s interval for about 2 hours are presented. 
2. Event 2: 19-Hz oscillation event. Real power, reactive power, and voltage voltage measuremets of 0.02-s interval are presented. 
3. Event 3: 20-Hz/80-Hz oscillation events. Real power, reactive power, voltage and current magnitudes and instantaneous voltage and current measurements are presented. Time interval: 50 microseconds. 
4. Event 4: subcycle overvoltage event. Time interval: 50 microseconds. 
5. Event 5: overcurrent event. Time interval: 50 microseconds. 
6. Frequency scan data: dq admittance from 0.01 Hz to 1000 Hz.
